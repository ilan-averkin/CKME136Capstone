##Load Dataset into R
```{r}
insurance <- read.csv("C:/Users/Ilan/Desktop/insurance.csv")
```
## Load the needed libraries
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(psych)
library(dplyr)
library(xgboost)
library(randomForest)
(tinytex.verbose = TRUE)
```
##A quick summary of the dataset reveals the different attributes we are dealing with
##is.na reveals if there are any missing variables in the dataset
```{r}
summary(insurance)
colSums (is.na(insurance))
```
##BOXPLOTS
```{r}
##A study was done about age to disease correlation. K-means was used to cluster the age groups, thus this will be used for the model
for(i in 1:nrow(insurance)){
  if(insurance$age[i] < 34){
    insurance$age_category[i] = "18-33"
  }else if(insurance$age[i] > 33 & insurance$age[i] < 49){
    insurance$age_category[i] = "34-48"
  }else{
    insurance$age_category[i] = "49-64"
  }
}

#In this age boxploto we are able to see that as age groups increase the charges go up as indivduals are more vulnerable to getting diseases and other medical problems.
ggplot(data = insurance, aes(age_category, charges)) + geom_boxplot(fill = c(1:3)) + ggtitle("Medical Charges by Gender, Boxplot")
```

```{r}
##For gender in relation to charges we are able to see that the data is relatively similar to and doesnt have a major affect on charges. Females seem to have more outliers which can be investigated furhter in the analysis
ggplot(data = insurance, aes(sex, charges)) + geom_boxplot(fill = c(1:2)) + ggtitle("Medical Charges by Gender, Boxplot")
```

```{r}
##For BMI it was decided to split the data into 3 categories to allow  the data to be more useful and helpful in predictor the output of charges. The 3 cateogires will allow the data to be utilized to its full potential and output a more accurate model
for (j in 1:nrow(insurance)) {
  if(insurance$bmi[j] < 18.5){
    insurance$bmi_category[j] = "underweight"
  }else if(insurance$bmi[j] > 30){
    insurance$bmi_category[j] = "overweight"
  }else{
    insurance$bmi_category[j] = "normal"
  }
}

##ggplot2 organizes the boxplot based on alphabetical order, here we are creating a new variable that organizes the data into the bmi categories
insurance$bmi_category1 <- factor(insurance$bmi_category, levels=unique(as.character(insurance$bmi_category)))

##In this boxplot of BMI in relation to charges we are able to see that being overweight has a major impact on charges compared to being normal and underweight as health issues arise when being obese
ggplot(data = insurance, aes(bmi_category1, charges)) + geom_boxplot(fill = c(1:3)) + ggtitle("Medical Charges for BMI Categories, Boxplot")
```

```{r}
##Here the children attribute was categorized into 3 different parts in order to create a balanced distribution as the original attribute was distributed between 1 - 5 children. The amount of clients with 4 or 5 children was minimal which wasnt balanced with the other values.
for (k in 1:nrow(insurance)){
  if(insurance$children[k] == 0){
    insurance$children_category[k] = "0"
  }else if(insurance$children[k] == 1){
    insurance$children_category[k] = "1"
  }else if(insurance$children[k] == 2){
    insurance$children_category[k] = "2"
  }else{
    insurance$children_category[k] = "3+"
  }
}

##In this boxplot we are able to see that the number of children doesnt have a drastic affect on charges as the boxplots are relatively the same size
ggplot(data = insurance, aes(children_category, charges)) + geom_boxplot(fill = c(1:4)) + ggtitle("Medical Charges by Number of Children, Boxplot")
```

```{r}
##In this boxplot for smoking we are able to see that indivduals who smoke have higher charges than non-smokers and is a great attribute in predicting future medical costs
ggplot(data = insurance, aes(smoker, charges)) + geom_boxplot(fill = c(1:2)) + ggtitle("Medical Charges from Smoking, Boxplot")
```

```{r}
##For the region boxplot it is evident that there is much affect on medical charges and will most likely be dropped when running the different models. This will be confirmed as we run the first test on the model and see the correlation to charges.
ggplot(data = insurance, aes(region, charges)) + geom_boxplot(fill = c(1:4)) + ggtitle("Medical Charges per Region, Boxplot")
```
##CORRELATION MATRIX
```{r}
##Created a new data frame in order to drop the original attributes that have been altered into new ones
insurance_new <- select(insurance, -c(age, bmi, bmi_category, children))

##Within the correlation matrix it is evident that there are 3 main attributes that are correlated with charges. These are age_category, smoker, and bmi_category. Although these 3 variables can be immediately used on the model, it is better to test all of them and slowly eliminate them as the results are outputted.
pairs.panels(insurance_new, pch = 1, lm = TRUE, cex.cor = 1, hist.col="darkorchid", smoother = T, show.points = TRUE, 
             density = TRUE, stars = TRUE, main="Correlation Matrix")
```
##HISTOGRAMS
```{r}
##This histogram is used to see the distribution of age to make sure it is balanced
ggplot(insurance, aes(x = age_category)) + geom_bar(color = "black", fill = "deepskyblue") + geom_text(stat="count", aes(label=..count..), vjust=4)
```

```{r}
##This histogram is used to see the distribution of sex to make sure it is balanced
ggplot(insurance, aes(x = sex)) + geom_bar(color = "black", fill = "deepskyblue") + geom_text(stat="count", aes(label=..count..), vjust=4)
```

```{r}
##Here one is able to see that the underweight category has a small amount of data assigned  to it, during the modeling stage the categories can be changed to obese (BMI > 30) and not obese (BMI < 30) to better fit the model
ggplot(insurance, aes(x = bmi_category1)) + geom_bar(color = "black", fill = "deepskyblue")+ geom_text(stat="count", aes(label=..count..), vjust=-1)
```

```{r}
##In this histogram we are checking the distribution of the amount of children for clients
ggplot(insurance, aes(children_category)) + geom_bar(color = "black", fill = "deepskyblue") + 
  geom_text(stat="count", aes(label=..count..), vjust=-1)
```

```{r}
##In this histogram we can see the distribution of smokers is not similar but since the correlation matrix shows that this is a signifcant attribute in relation to charges, it is acceptable
ggplot(insurance, aes(x = smoker)) + geom_bar(color = "black", fill = "deepskyblue") + geom_text(stat="count", aes(label=..count..), vjust=4)
```

```{r}
##The distribution for region is very close and will not be altered
ggplot(insurance, aes(x = region)) + geom_bar(color = "black", fill = "deepskyblue") + geom_text(stat="count", aes(label=..count..), vjust=4)
```
##SCATTER PLOTS
```{r}
##In this scatter plot of age_category we can see that each age group is split up into 3 clusters, this can be in relation to different attributes which will be assesed later on
ggplot(insurance, aes(x = age_category, y = charges)) + geom_jitter(aes(age_category), alpha = 0.7) + labs(x = "Age_Category", y = "Charges") +  ggtitle("Relationship Between Age_Category and Charges")
```

```{r}
##In this scatter plot of BMI category we can see that overweight category has higher charges than normal and underweight
ggplot(insurance, aes(x = bmi_category1, y = charges)) + geom_jitter(aes(bmi_category1), alpha = 0.7) + 
  labs(x = "BMI_Category", y = "Charges") +  ggtitle("Relationship Between BMI_Category1 and Charges")
```

```{r}
##In this scatter plot we can see the age distribution and how smoking affects the charges. As you can see there is a difference when individual smokes versus when they dont.
ggplot(insurance, aes(x = age_category, y = charges)) + geom_jitter(aes(color = smoker), alpha = 0.7) + 
  labs(x = "Age", y = "Charges", col = "Smoker Legend") +  ggtitle("Relationship Between Age, Smokers, and Charges")
```

```{r}
##Here we can see that BMI has a a big affect on the charges as a majority of the overweight indivduals are higher on the graph in comparison to normal and underweight individuals
ggplot(insurance, aes(x = age_category, y = charges)) + geom_jitter(aes(color = bmi_category1), alpha = 0.7) + 
  labs(x = "Age", y = "Charges", col = "BMI Category Legend") +  ggtitle("Relationship Between Age, BMI Category, and Charges")
```

```{r}
##Here we can see that if you are obese and a smoker your charges skyrocket and you can see the major gap between obese and no smoker vs obese and smoker, with a few outliers
ggplot(insurance, aes(x = bmi_category1, y = charges)) + geom_jitter(aes(color = smoker), alpha = 0.7) + 
  labs(x = "BMI Category", y = "Charges", col = "Smoker Legend") +  ggtitle("Relationship Between BMI Category, Smokers, and Charges")
```
##ALGORITHMS
```{r}
##MULTI-LINEAR REGRESSION

##Setting the seed allows me to reproduce the output of the algorithm
set.seed(1)

##Here I am splitting the data into a training set and test set
selection <- sample(1:nrow(insurance_new), 0.8 * nrow(insurance_new))
train_LM = insurance_new[selection, ]
test_LM = insurance_new[-selection, ]

##This is the first model with all the attributes                    
LM <- lm(charges ~ sex + smoker + region + age_category + bmi_category1 + children_category, data = train_LM)
##First off we see that the Multiple R-squared values is 0.7729 which shows that the model explains the large value of variance in the model and is a good fit
##Furthermore we can analyze the p-values to get a better understanding of which variable is helping the model versus hindering it
summary(LM)
```

```{r}
##XGBOOST
##NOT READY, still testing the paramaters and making sure everything works together
# set.seed(2)
# 
# selection1 <- sample(1:nrow(insurance_new), 0.8 * nrow(insurance_new))
# train_XGB = insurance_new[selection1, ]
# test_XGB = insurance_new[-selection1, ]
# 
# XGB <- xgboost(data = train_XGB(),
#                label = insurance$charges,
#                eta = 0.1,
#                max_depth = 15,
#                nround = 25,
#                subsample = 0.5,
#                colsample_bytree = 0.5,
#                seed = 2,
#  eval_metric = "merror",
#  objective = "multi:softprob",
#  num_class = 12,
#  nthread = 3
#               )
```

```{r}
##RANDOMFOREST

##Split the data into training, validation, and test
selection2 <- sample(1:nrow(insurance_new), 0.8 * nrow(insurance_new))

training_RF <- insurance_new[selection2, ]
validation_RF <- insurance_new[selection2, ]

##Here we can see that the variance explained is at 83.45% which is very good
rf = randomForest(charges ~ sex + smoker + region + age_category + bmi_category1 + children_category, data = training_RF, ntree = 100, mtry = 2, importance = TRUE)
```
